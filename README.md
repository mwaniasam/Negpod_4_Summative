#ALU  Student Record Management Script

This script helps manage student records by moving files associated with a specific Negpod ID (student identifier) to a dedicated directory named negpod_id-<Negpod_ID>-q1.

How to Use:

Requirements:
  * Bash shell (most Linux/macOS systems have this by default)

Instructions:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script (e.g., cd ~/student-records).
3. Run the script with the Negpod ID as an argument (e.g., ./move-to-directory.sh 1234).
